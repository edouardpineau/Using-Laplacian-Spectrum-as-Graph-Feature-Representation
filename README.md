# ICLR2020

This repository presents a notebook to reproduce the experiments of the paper ["Study of a Simple, Expressive and Consistant Graph Feature Representation"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkeqb1BFvB), submitted at ICLR 2020.

WARNING: the results printed within the notebook are obtained with 5 molecular datasets whose 4 are provided in folder 'Data' of this repository. The fifth one is 'DD' that is too large to be loaded in the repository. The dataset can be found here: https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets. The notebook can also be run without the 'DD' dataset by simply deleting 'DD' from the list within the third cell of the notebook.
