This repository presents a notebook to reproduce the experiments of the preprint paper notes "Using Laplacian Spectrum as Graph Feature Representation", that present the theoretical explanation of the good results obtained in the paper ["A simple baseline algorithm for graph classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09155) (see ["here"](https://github.com/edouardpineau/A-simple-baseline-algorithm-for-graph-classification)).

WARNING: the results printed within the notebook are obtained with 5 molecular datasets whose 1 (Mutag) is provided in folder 'Data' of this repository. The other datasets can be found here: https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets.
